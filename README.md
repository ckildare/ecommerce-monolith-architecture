## The Goals of This Project

- :sparkle: Implementing `Vertical Slice Architecture` at the architecture level to create a `scalable` and `maintainable` structure for the application.
- :sparkle: Using `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` for implementing `business processes` and `validation rules`.
- :sparkle: Adopting `CQRS` implementation with the `MediatR` library for better separation of `write` and `read` operations.
- :sparkle: Implementing `MediatR` to `reduce coupling` and provide support for managing `cross-cutting concerns` within `pipelines`, including `validation` and `transaction handling` for the application.
- :sparkle: Using `Postgres` as our `relational database` management system at the database level.
- :sparkle: Incorporating `Unit Testing`, `Integration Testing`, and `End To End Testing` for testing level to ensure the `robustness` and `reliability` of the application.
- :sparkle: Utilizing `Fluent Validation` and a `Validation Pipeline Behaviour` on top of `MediatR` to validate requests and responses and ensure `data integrity`.
- :sparkle: Using `Minimal API` for all endpoints to create a `lightweight` and `streamlined` API.
- :sparkle: Using `Docker-Compose` for our `deployment` mechanism to enable easy deployment and scaling of the application.

## Structure of Project

In this project I used [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) and [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) to structure my files.

To `reduce coupling` in our code, we leverage `Mediatr` and `build pipelines` on top of it to handle `validation`, `logging`, and `transactions`. Our `domain` follows `Domain-Driven Design` principles and employs `value objects` for `business logic`. We also incorporate validation into our business processes. When we complete work within our domain, it raises a `domain event`. Depending on the requirements, we can then react to this event and take appropriate action to further our business goals.

I `treat each request` as a `distinct` use case or `slice`, `encapsulating` and `grouping` `all concerns` from front-end to back with `vertical slice architecture`.
In traditional approach like `clean architecture`, When `adding` or `changing` a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically `touching many layers` in an application. We are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of `coupling across` a layer in traditional architecture, we `couple vertically along a slice`. We `minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our `vertical slices` can `decide for itself` how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

In traditional ASP.net controllers, related action methods are usually grouped in one controller. However, in my recent project, I opted to use the [REPR pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern) (Route-Endpoint-Presenter-Resource) design pattern instead. With this pattern, each action is given its own small endpoint, consisting of a route, the action, and an `IMediator` instance (see [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)), which is handled by a request-specific IRequestHandler to perform business logic before returning the result. This approach not only `separates` the action `logic` into `individual handlers`, but it also supports the `Single Responsibility`, `Open Close Principle` and `Don't Repeat Yourself` principles, resulting in `clean` and `thin controllers`.

To achieve better separation of concerns and cross-cutting concerns, I used the [Mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) in combination with `CQRS` (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to `decompose features` into `small`, `vertical slices`. `Each slice` has a `group of classes specific to that feature`, including `command`, `handlers`, `infrastructure`, `repository`, and `controllers`. By grouping them together, we can easily maximize `performance`, `scalability`, and `simplicity`, as well as maintain and add features without creating breaking changes or side effects.

With `CQRS`, we can `reduce coupling` between layers and tune down specific methods to not follow general conventions. This is achieved by `cutting each business functionality into vertical slices`, where each command/query handler is a separate slice. As a result, each handler can be a `separate code unit`, even copy/pasted, allowing us to customize individual methods as needed. In contrast, in a `traditional layered` architecture, `changing the core generic mechanism` in `one layer` can `impact all methods`, which can be `time-consuming` and `challenging` to `maintain`.

Overall, by using the `REPR` pattern and `CQRS` with the `Mediator` pattern, we can create a `better-structured` and more `maintainable` application, with improved `separation of concerns`.

## Development Setup

### Dotnet Tool Packages
For installing our requirement package with .NET cli tools, we need to install `dotnet tool manifest`.
```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
```
And after that we can restore our dotnet tool packages with .NET cli tools from `.config` folder and `dotnet-tools.json` file.
```
dotnet tool restore
```

## How to Run

### Docker Compose

Run this app in docker using the [docker-compose.yml](./deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) file with the below command at the `root` of the application:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
